NOTE! These will most likely be auto-generated in the future, and serve as placeholders for efforts outside of core.

Current Pattern:
* @class definition matches SOL_USERTYPE() declaration
* Filename is named after SOL_USERTYPE() declaration
* sol::variadic_args and sol::object variables are limited to expected casts

TODO:
* Once Automation is applied, add @source annotations
* If getter function, set nodiscard

NOTE:
* Lua Stylecheck will hit this directory, so function definitions need to follow formatting of end being on a newline
